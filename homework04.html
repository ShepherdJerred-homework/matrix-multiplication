      You are to write an MPI program which is able to multiply a matrix and a
      vector.  The matrix should be an <var>M&times;N</var> matrix
      (<var>M</var> rows, <var>N</var> columns) where <var>M</var> is the
      number of processes.  The vector can be thought of as
      a <var>N&times;1</var> matrix&mdash;i.e., a single column.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you multiply these together, you will get an <var>M&times;1</var>
      matrix&mdash;i.e., a column vector with as many rows as the matrix.
      Each row in the answer is calculated as the dot product of the
      corresponding row in the matrix with the vector.  As an example,
      consider the following multiplication.  Note that in this
      example, <var>M</var> is 4 and <var>N</var> is 3.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your program should begin by reading <var>N</var>, the number of
      columns.  (As mentioned above, we will assume that <var>M</var> is equal
      to the number of processes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next <var>M&times;N</var> numbers should be the matrix in row-major
      order.  After that should be <var>N</var> numbers representing the
      vector.  In the example above, our program would need to be run with
      four processes, and the input would be as follows:
    </p>
    <pre class="example">
3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1 -1 2
</pre>
    <p>
      Note that your program should not care about spacing in the input; it
      should just read in numbers.  Thus, if desired, the input above could be
      formatted like so:
    </p>
    <pre class="example">
3

 1  2  3
 4  5  6
 7  8  9
10 11 12

 1
-1
 2
</pre>
    <p>
      Your main process should read in the input, broadcast <var>N</var> and
      the vector, then scatter the matrix.  Each process should calculate the
      dot product of its row by the vector.  Then gather the results back into
      a vector in the main process.  The main process should print the
      resulting matrix out&mdash;one number per line (like a column vector).
      In the example above, the output would be
    </p>
    <pre class="example">
5
11
17
23</pre>
    <p>
      I also want you to turn in three input/output test cases that
      demonstrate the correctness of your student.  In none of your test cases
      should <var>N</var> = 1.  (That's a good thing to test, but I want to see three
      more complicated test cases.)  At least one of these should use 64
      processes.  You may want to use a script to generate these data files as
      they will be fairly large.
    </p>
    <h3>On 2-Dimensional Arrays</h3>
    <p>
      Note that in this assignment you do <em>not</em> need to store the
      matrix in a 2-dimensional array.  While a 2-dimensional array is a good
      representation of a matrix, making a variable-size 2-dimensional array
      is a little tricky if you've never done it before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead, make a 1-dimensional array that is big enough to hold the
      entire matrix, then simply distribute them to the different
      processes <var>N</var> at a time.  This will result in each process
      getting its correct row.  And, of course, a row is just a
      1-dimensional array.
